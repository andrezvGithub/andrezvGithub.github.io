        <h3>About Me:</h3>
        <p>Hi! I am Andrez Miguel A. Velasquez and my nickname is Miggy.</p>
        <p>My favorite CMSC subject so far is CMSC 131 because I am very interested in learning how to use assembly language.</p>
        <p>My favorite GE so far is PI 10 because I am excited to learn more about Rizal and his works.</p>
        <p>My favorite programming language so far is Java because the syntax seems simple and the problem sets we have look challenging.</p>
        <p>My favorite food is subs (submarine sandwiches)</p>
